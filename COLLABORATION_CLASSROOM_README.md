## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Socket.io Client** - Real-time bidirectional communication
- **WebRTC API** - Peer-to-peer video/audio streaming
- **Canvas API** - Interactive whiteboard rendering
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

### Backend
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Express.js** - Web framework
- **Socket.io** - WebSocket server
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe backend code

## Architecture

### WebRTC Connection Flow
1. User joins room via Socket.io
2. Socket.io signals new participant to existing peers
3. Existing peers create WebRTC offers
4. New participant responds with answers
5. ICE candidates exchanged for NAT traversal
6. Peer-to-peer media streams established

### Whiteboard Synchronization
1. User draws on local canvas
2. Draw data emitted to Socket.io server
3. Server broadcasts to all room participants
4. Participants render draw data on their canvas
5. Full whiteboard state sent to new joiners

### Screen Sharing Flow
1. User initiates screen share
2. Browser prompts for screen selection
3. Screen stream captured via getDisplayMedia
4. Stream added to WebRTC peer connections
5. Remote peers receive and display screen stream
