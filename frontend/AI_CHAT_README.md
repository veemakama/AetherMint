      courseId="course-123"
      className="h-full"
    />
  );
}
```

### Voice Interaction
```typescript
const { isListening, transcript, startListening, stopListening } = useSpeechRecognition({
  language: 'en-US',
  continuous: false,
  interimResults: true
});

// Start voice input
startListening();
```

### Text-to-Speech
```typescript
const { speak, speaking, supported } = useTextToSpeech({
  language: 'en-US',
  rate: 1.0,
  pitch: 1.0,
